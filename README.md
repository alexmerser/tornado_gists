About tornado_gists
===================

This is a [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) web app that integrates with 
[Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/) so that people in the Tornado
community can share snippets of code with each other. 

Anybody can log in (using their Github account) and start adding gists
and discuss them. **Not** only **their own** but anybody's gist. 

About the code
--------------

All the code is of course Open Source and is licensed under the [Apache
Licence, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

It's by no means perfect and absolutely not the ideal way of writing a
Tornado app (because there is no such way). 

To run the code you simply need a MongoDB (of a recentish version) and
install MongoKit which clues MongoDB to Tornado.
